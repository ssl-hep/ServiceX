# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

### Added

- option to use direct to logstash logging.

### Removed

- standalone chart for filebeat logging.

## Unreleased 1.0.30

### Added

- DID Finder now returns an ordered list of replicas. If transformer is unable
to open a replica then it can go down the list to find an accesible file
- DID finder can take URI parameters `files`, `rucio://datset-name?files=10` and it will
  return only 10 files from the dataset. By default all flies are returned
- DID finder can take URI prameter `get`, `rucio://data-set?get=availible` and only files
  in a dataset that are availible will be returned. If `all` is supplied instead, then all
  files must be returned. Anything less throws an error.
- About page on web ui to show the deployed version information
- xAOD code generator now works with metadata allowing one to alter its behavior on-the-fly to support
  all collections and obejcts in the ATLAS xAOD

### Changed

- In helm chart, split the default transformer image into two values. One for image
name and a second one for just the tag. This makes it easier for the deployment
script to update the transformer tag.
-

### Fixed

- Correct missing permissions required to use POSIX volume for transform results
- Rucio DID Finder correctly handles files for which there are no replicas

### Removed
