ServiceX Code Generator
-----------------------
This microservice is a REST API that will generate C++ source code that runs in the ATLAS environment to generate code that will extract columns of data from ATLAS xAOD binary files. The query to extract the data is generated by the func-adl LINQ-like language, and specified to the service useing the ast-language.

Debugging & Tools
-----------------

Sometimes it is useful to generate C++ from the `ast-language` text. There is a utility in `scripts/from_ast_to_zip.py` that will do this for you. For example:
```
 echo "(call ResultTTree (call Select (call SelectMany (call EventDataset (list 'localds://did_01')) (lambda (list e) (call (attr e 'Jets') ''))) (lambda (list j) (call (attr j 'pt')))) (list 'jet_pt') 'analysis' 'junk.root')" | python ./scripts/from_ast_to_zip.py -z junk.zip
```

This will generate a zip file that contains the C++ source code.
