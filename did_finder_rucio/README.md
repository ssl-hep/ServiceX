For a given RUCIO DID finds optimal access paths.

## Overview

This service is intended to run as part of a [ServiceX](https://github.com/ssl-hep/ServiceX)
deployment. In that role it listens for Dataset Lookup requests on the
`rucio_did_requests` RabbitMQ queue. Upon receipt, it asks Rucio to resolve the
dataset and return the files that make it up. The server selects a replica and
passes it back to the ServiceX app to request transformation.

## Build Image

Build the docker image as:

```bash
% docker build -t  sslhep/servicex-did-finder .
```

The latest image is also available on [dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/sslhep/repository/docker/sslhep/servicex-did-finder)

## Running

The service requires two volumes to be mounted in order to operate:

1. A valid x509 proxy certificate in `/etc/grid-security-ro`.
There is a script that usually gets run to copy the cert to a correctly permissioned
directory. The location of the cert can be overridden by setting the X509_USER_PROXY
environment variable.

2. Rucio config file in `/opt/rucio/etc/`

## Command Line Arguments

The server accepts the following arguments when it is launched

|Argument       |Description                                                                |Default   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
|`--rabbit-uri` | A valid URI to the RabbitMQ Broker                                        | None     |

### Rucio Config

The service requires a custom `rucio.cfg` which contains the CERN account name
associated with the provided Certs. A template .cfg file is provided in this
repo's `config` directory. Ordinarily this would be constructed by the helm chart.

To get an optimal (usually closest) file replica, two environment variables have to be set: RUCIO_LATITUDE and RUCIO_LONGITUDE. This is normally done through helm chart values.

To run a standalone test against for example ATLAS rucio instance do:

```bash
setupATLAS
lsetup rucio
voms-proxy-init
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 direct_test/test1.py
```
