[ServiceX](https://github.com/ssl-hep/ServiceX), a component of the
[IRIS-HEP](https://iris-hep.org/) Intelligent Data Delivery Service, is an experiment-agnostic
service to enable on-demand columnar data delivery tailored for nearly interactive, high
performance, array-based Pythonic analyses. It provides a uniform backend interface to data storage
services and an intuitive frontend for users to enable columnar transformations from multiple
different data formats and organizational structures.
