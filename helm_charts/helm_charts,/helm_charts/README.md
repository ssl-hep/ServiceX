 # ServiceX - Data Delivery for the HEP Community

ServiceX is an on-demand service that delivers data straight from the grid to high energy physics analysts in an easy, flexible, and highly performant manner.

## Features
- __Experiment-agnostic:__ Supports both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on the LHC.
- __Custom filters and pre-processing:__ Easily filter events, request specific columns, and unpack compressed formats using the [func-adl](https://github.com/iris-hep/func_adl) analysis description language.
- __Choose your format:__ ServiceX can deliver data in a variety of columnar formats, including streams of ROOT data, small ROOT files, HDF5, and Apache Arrow buffers.
- __No hassle:__ ServiceX uses Rucio to find and access data wherever it lives, so users don't have to worry about these details.
- __Simple and Pythonic:__ Using ServiceX takes only a few lines of code in any Python environment, such as a script  or Jupyter notebook.

## Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/servicex/badge/?version=latest)](https://servicex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The [ServiceX documentation](https://servicex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is hosted on Read the Docs.

## Self-Hosting

The [Scalable Systems Laboratory](https://iris-hep.org/ssl.html) (SSL) at IRIS-HEP maintains multiple instances of ServiceX to transform several input formats from different experiments.

In addition, ServiceX is an open-source project, and you are welcome to host your own deployment. Instructions on how to configure and deploy ServiceX can be found in our [deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md).
