ServiceX Code Generator
-----------------------
This microservice is a REST API that will generate python code for use in 
uproot transformer. The query to extract the data is generated by the 
func-adl LINQ-like language, and specified to the service using the ast-language.

Usage
-----
This repo builds a container to be used in the `ServiceX` application. You can 
see the containers on docker hub.

### Running the web service

The default is to run a web service that will take a `qastle` as input and 
return a binary zip file as output. To start that up, use the following 
docker command:

```
 docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000  sslhep/servicex_code_gen_funcadl_uproot:latest
```

You can now make queries against port 5000.

### Translating a `qastle` into code
For debugging purposes you sometimes want to translate an `ast` into a zip file. 
This container will also do that for you:

```
AST="(Select (call EventDataset) (lambda (list event) (dict (list 'pt' 'eta') (list (attr event 'Muon_pt') (attr event 'Muon_eta')))))" 
echo $AST | docker run -i --rm -v ${PWD}:/zip sslhep/servicex_code_gen_funcadl_uproot:latest from_ast_to_zip.py -z /zip/junk.zip
```

After running, that will leave a `zip` file in your home directory that contains 
the 6 or so files necessary to run the requested transform. The only thing 
missing are the input files.



Development
-----------
- Note that this service requires Python 3.7 or above
- Use `pytest` to run the tests
- Use the `postman` template to send some sample queries to the service.

- Create a bash shell in the container with the source code mounted in /code
and an Docker volume provided to store the generated code.

```
docker run --rm -it \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/code \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/generated,target=/generated \
  --entrypoint bash \
  sslhep/servicex_code_gen_funcadl_uproot:develop 
```

Then cd to /code and run the script as
```bash
 echo $AST | PYTHONPATH=/code python scripts/from_ast_to_zip.py -z /generated/foo.zip --uproot
```
